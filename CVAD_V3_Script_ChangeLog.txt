#Original script created on October 20, 2013
#started updating for CVAD version 2006 on August 10, 2020

# This script is based on the 2.36 script

#Version 3.36 25-Jul-2022
#	Added support for Minimum Catalog Level 2206 (L7_34)

#Version 3.35 16-Jul-2022
#	Added Broker Registry Key:
#		HKLM:\Software\Policies\Citrix\DesktopServer\MaxCompletedActionsToPurge
#			Type: int
#			Default: 700
#			Info: Minimum=100
#			Summary: Maximum completed power actions to purge in a single batch. 
#					 This limit avoids timeouts/failures if for some reason huge numbers of actions have accumulated that need to be deleted.
#
#			         The default value allows for about 2 million actions to be purged per day if needed (700 every 30 seconds).
#
#		HKLM:\Software\Policies\Citrix\DesktopServer\ParallelPowerStateReadMaxThreads
#			Type: int
#			Default: 5
#			Info: Minimum=0, Maximum=100
#			Summary: Maximum number of threads to use when reading multiple machine states from the HCL in parallel. 
#					 Note: (1) Value does not apply to HCL plugins that support bulk power state operations (e.g. Azure). 
#					 (2) For Cloud, value is capped at 1 as the RemoteHCL does not support multiple concurrent operations, 
#					 thus there's no advantage in using multiple threads. (3) A value of zero forces use of a simple loop 
#					 for all such operations. This puts all machine state reads and database writes into a single thread. 
#					 This uses the minimum resources but at the expense of throughput, and delayed database updates.
#	Added Computer policy

#	Added Computer policy
#		ICA\Rendezvous proxy configuration
#	Added to Hosting Connection section:
#	Thanks to fellow CTPs Neil Spellings, Kees Baggerman, and Trond Eirik Haavarstein for getting this info for me
#		Microsoft Configuration Manager Wake on LAN   
#		Nutanix AHV
#		Remote PC Wake on LAN (corrected)
#	Added to the Site Settings section, Site Provisioning Settings based on CTX241288 (Thanks to Per Lorentzen)

#	Correct the invalid variable name in the ScriptInfo output file for WordFilename
#	Fixed alignment in the Text output for the ScriptInfo output file
#	Fixed bug reported by David Prows in the Hosting section. First, check to see if the hosting connection's 
#		AdditionalStorage.StorageLocations is valid
#	For all calls to Get-AdminAdministrator, remove the -SortBy Name. Sorting by Name is the default behavior.
#	For HTML and MSWord/PDF output, changed the formatting for the Application setting "How do you want to control the use of this application?"
#	For MCS Machine Catalogs:
#		Check that the catalog's ProvisioningSchemeId is not $Null before retrieving the Provision Scheme's machine data
#		Check that $MachneData is not $Null before checking for HostingUnitName
#	For the Hosting section, for High Availability Servers and Power Actions, handle empty arrays
#	In Function GetAdmins, for Hosting Connections, handle the error "The property 'ScopeId' cannot be found on this object. Verify that the property exists."
#		Also, add some white space to make the function easier for me to read
#	In Function OutputAdminsForDetails, add "No Admins found" to replace blank tables and text output
#	In Function OutputAppendixD, adjust the Text output to handle longer component names
#	In Function OutputCVADLicenses, if there are no licenses installed, output the text "Citrix Virtual Desktops 7 Premium (30-day trial)"
#	In Function OutputDeliveryGroupCatalogs, handle the case where a Delivery Group has no Machine Catalog(s) assigned
#	In Function OutputMachineDetails, when using Test-NetConnection, add Resolve-DnsName first to see if the machine name is resolvable. 
#		This prevents every call to Test-NetConnection from failing with "<MachineName> was not found in DNS". Add error message:
#		<MachineName> was not found in DNS. VDA Registry Key data cannot be gathered.
#		Otherwise, every machine was reported as offline, which may not be true.
#	In Function OutputPerZoneView, add "There are no zone members for Zone <ZoneName>" to replace blank tables and text output
#	Reordered the parameters in an order recommended by Guy Leech
#	Updated for CVAD 2012

#		Update help text to show elevation is required when using BrokerRegistryKeys
#	When getting the Master VM for an MCS based machine catalog, also check for images ending in .template for Nutanix

#Version 3.01 11-Sep-2020
#	Add a switch statement for the machine/desktop/server Power State
#	Change all Write-Verbose $(Get-Date) to add -Format G to put the dates in the user's locale
#	Change checking some String variables from just $Null to [String]::IsNullOrEmpty.
#		Some cmdlet's string properties are sometimes Null and sometimes an empty string
#	Change checking the way a machine is online or offline.
#	Change some cmdlets to sort on the left of the pipeline using the cmdlet's -SortBy option
#	Fixed an issue with "Connections meeting any of the following (Access Gateway) filters".
#		If you selected HTML and any other output format in the same run, only the HTML output had any Access Gateway data.
#	Fixed issue with PowerShell 5.1.x and empty Hashtables for Ian Brighton's Word Table functions
#		PoSH 3, 4, and 5.0 had no problem with an empty hashtable and would create a blank Word table with only column headings
#		For many tables, before passing the hashtable to Ian's function, test if the hashtable is empty
#		If it is, create a dummy row of data for the hashtable
#		For example, a RemotePC catalog based on OU that contains no machines, or Applications with no administrators. 
#		Instead of having a missing table, the table will now have a row that says "None found"
#	Fixed issue with the array used for Appendix A and the CSV file when selecting multiple output formats.
#		If HTML and Text and MSWord were selected, Appendix A and the CSV file contained three duplicate entries
#		Changed from using only one array to three. Changed from using $Script:ALLVDARegistryItems to
#			$Script:WordALLVDARegistryItems
#			$Script:TextALLVDARegistryItems
#			$Script:HTMLALLVDARegistryItems
#	Fixed output issues with Power Management settings
#	Fixed several more array out of bounds issues when accessing element 0 when the array was empty
#	For Appendix A, Text output, change the column heading "DDC Name" to "Computer Name" to match the HTML and MSWord/PDF output
#	For checking the registry on a Delivery Controller for installed Citrix components, test the RemoteRegistry service for its status.
#		If the service is not running, set $GotCtxComponents to $False
#	For the three datastore databases, check if the various variable are null or empty and if so, change the value to "Unable to determine"
#	For Zones, add MemType into the Sort-Object for Site View and Zone View
#	Since the RegistrationState property is an enum, add .ToString() to the machine/desktop/server variable so HTML output is correct
#	When getting the provisioning scheme data for a machine, only process machines with a provisioning type of MCS
#		There is no provisioning scheme data for manually or PVS provisioned machines
#	When VDARegistryKeys is used, now test the RemoteRegistry service for its status.
#		If the service is not running, add that information into the various *VDARegistryItems arrays
