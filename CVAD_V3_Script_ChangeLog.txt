#		<MachineName> was not found in DNS. VDA Registry Key data cannot be gathered.
#		Otherwise, every machine was reported as offline, which may not be true.
#	In Function OutputPerZoneView, add "There are no zone members for Zone <ZoneName>" to replace blank tables and text output

#Version 3.01 11-Sep-2020
#	Add a switch statement for the machine/desktop/server Power State
#	Change all Write-Verbose $(Get-Date) to add -Format G to put the dates in the user's locale
#	Change checking some String variables from just $Null to [String]::IsNullOrEmpty.

#		If you selected HTML and any other output format in the same run, only the HTML output had any Access Gateway data.
#	Fixed issue with PowerShell 5.1.x and empty Hashtables for Ian Brighton's Word Table functions
#		PoSH 3, 4, and 5.0 had no problem with an empty hashtable and would create a blank Word table with only column headings
#		For many tables, before passing the hashtable to Ian's function, test if the hashtable is empty
#		If it is, create a dummy row of data for the hashtable
#		For example, a RemotePC catalog based on OU that contains no machines, or Applications with no administrators. 
#		Instead of having a missing table, the table will now have a row that says "None found"
#	Fixed issue with the array used for Appendix A and the CSV file when selecting multiple output formats.
#		If HTML and Text and MSWord were selected, Appendix A and the CSV file contained three duplicate entries
#		Changed from using only one array to three. Changed from using $Script:ALLVDARegistryItems to
#			$Script:WordALLVDARegistryItems
#			$Script:TextALLVDARegistryItems
#			$Script:HTMLALLVDARegistryItems
#	Fixed output issues with Power Management settings
#	Fixed several more array out of bounds issues when accessing element 0 when the array was empty
#	For Appendix A, Text output, change the column heading "DDC Name" to "Computer Name" to match the HTML and MSWord/PDF output
#	For checking the registry on a Delivery Controller for installed Citrix components, test the RemoteRegistry service for its status.
#		If the service is not running, set $GotCtxComponents to $False
#	For the three datastore databases, check if the various variable are null or empty and if so, change the value to "Unable to determine"
#	For Zones, add MemType into the Sort-Object for Site View and Zone View
#	Since the RegistrationState property is an enum, add .ToString() to the machine/desktop/server variable so HTML output is correct
#	When getting the provisioning scheme data for a machine, only process machines with a provisioning type of MCS
#		There is no provisioning scheme data for manually or PVS provisioned machines
#	When VDARegistryKeys is used, now test the RemoteRegistry service for its status.
#		If the service is not running, add that information into the various *VDARegistryItems arrays
